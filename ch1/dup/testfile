I've got a secret, I cannot say
Blame all the movement to give it away
You've got somethin, I understand
Holding it tightly, caught on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Look for reflections, in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner, locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Still can't believe there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
We've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm taking my song to the grave
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
